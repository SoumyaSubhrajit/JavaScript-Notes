## Chapter 1: Genesis - The Birth of JavaScript

In the mid-1990s, Brendan Eich, a visionary programmer at Netscape, set out to create a language that would bring interactivity to the burgeoning realm of web development. Initially christened "Mocha," this language underwent a series of name changes before finally settling on the moniker "JavaScript."

## Chapter 2: The Strategic Affiliation with Java

Recognizing the growing popularity of Java, Netscape decided to align its nascent language with this formidable force. Thus, LiveScript underwent a transformation, not in essence but in nomenclature, becoming JavaScript. This strategic move positioned JavaScript to benefit from the Java brand's recognition and ecosystem.

## Chapter 3: JavaScript as a Brand

JavaScript evolved beyond a mere scripting language, ascending to the status of a brand synonymous with client-side dynamism in web development. Its ability to add interactivity and responsiveness to web pages made it an indispensable tool for web developers, propelling it to the forefront of web development./

## Chapter 4: The Chronicles of ECMAScript Standardization

As JavaScript's popularity grew, the need for standardization became apparent. In response, the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) International took up the mantle of scrutiny, culminating in the birth of the ECMAScript standard in 1997. This standardization provided a solid foundation for the language's future development and ensured its cross-platform compatibility..

## Chapter 5: Browser Wars and the Renaissance of JavaScript

The late '90s witnessed the tumultuous Browser Wars, a period of intense competition among web browsers. Amidst this maelstrom, JavaScript matured and evolved, adapting to the changing landscape and setting the stage for a renaissance. The advent of AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) in the mid-2000s further catalyzed JavaScript's resurgence, enabling seamless and responsive web experiences.

## Chapter 6: Expanding Horizons - JavaScript Beyond the Browser

JavaScript's journey extended beyond the confines of the browser, venturing into the realm of server-side programming with the advent of Node.js. This opened up new avenues for JavaScript's application, positioning it as a formidable force in full-stack development. Node.js enabled JavaScript to be used for building scalable and efficient server-side applications, making it a versatile language suitable for both front-end and back-end development..

## Chapter 7: The Tapestry of Community

Central to JavaScript's narrative is its vibrant community, a thriving ecosystem of developers, libraries, and frameworks. This collaborative spirit has propelled JavaScript towards limitless possibilities, fostering innovation and driving the language's continuous evolution. The JavaScript community is known for its openness, inclusivity, and willingness to share knowledge and expertise.

## Conclusion

Our exploration of JavaScript's history and evolution has provided a glimpse into the intricate journey of this remarkable language. From its humble beginnings to its current status as a dominant force in web development, JavaScript has come a long way. In Module 2, we will delve deeper into the depths of JavaScript's syntax, unraveling the coding wonders that define this versatile language. Until then, keep exploring and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with JavaScript!

# JavaScript: A Deeper Dive

#### The Name Game

The name "JavaScript" is a bit of a marketing gimmick. When Brendan Eich first created the language, he called it "Mocha." Then, Netscape, the company behind JavaScript, decided to change the name to "LiveScript" internally. But when it came time to release the language to the public, they decided to call it "JavaScript."

Why? Because Java was really popular at the time, and Netscape wanted to capitalize on that popularity. They figured that by calling their language "JavaScript," they could attract more developers who were already familiar with Java.

But here's the thing: JavaScript and Java are actually very different languages. Java is a compiled language, which means that it's converted into machine code before it can be run. JavaScript, on the other hand, is an interpreted language, which means that it's executed directly by the browser.

So, while the name "JavaScript" might have helped the language gain popularity in the early days, it's also caused a lot of confusion over the years. Some people think that JavaScript is just a simplified version of Java, when in reality it's a completely different language.

That's why some people have suggested that we start using the name "JS" instead of "JavaScript." JS is a more accurate and less confusing name for the language.

#### Legal and Standardization Matters

In some ways, the legal relationships between JavaScript and Java run deeper than just the syntax. Oracle (via Sun), the company that still owns and runs Java, also owns the official trademark for the name "JavaScript" (via Netscape). This trademark is almost never enforced, but it's still a potential legal issue.

To further distance JavaScript from the Oracle-owned trademark, the official name of the language specified by TC39 and formalized by the ECMA standards body is ECMAScript. Since 2016, the official language name has also been suffixed by the revision year. As of this writing, that's ECMAScript 2019, or ES2019 for short.

In other words, the JavaScript/JS that runs in your browser or in Node.js is an implementation of the ES2019 standard.

#### The TC39 Committee

The TC39 committee is responsible for the standardization of JavaScript. It's comprised of between 50 and 100 people from a broad section of web-invested companies, such as browser makers (Mozilla, Google, Apple) and device makers (Samsung, etc.). All members of the committee are volunteers, though many of them are employees of these companies and may receive compensation for their work on the committee.

TC39 meets generally about every other month to review work done by members, discuss issues, and vote on proposals. Meeting locations rotate among member companies willing to host.

All proposals are managed in the open, on TC39's GitHub repository: https://github.com/tc39/proposals
